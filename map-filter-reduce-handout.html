//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

//var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
// var numbersAddOne =[];
// for(var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1){
//     numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i] + 1);
// }
// console.log(numbersAddOne);
//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

// let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(function(num){
//     return num + 1;
// });
// console.log(numbersAddOneMap);

//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!


//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins
const restaurant = [
    {
    name: "Gou Lakay",
    phone: "123-123-1234"
    },
    {
        name: "Asian Buffet",
        phone: "321-321-4321",
        restaurantFeatures: ["buffet"]
    }
];

//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins
let coolRestaurant = restaurant.map(Name=>`${Name.name} is a cool reastaurant`);
console.log(coolRestaurant);

//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
// var evens = [];
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
//     if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
//         evens.push(numbers[i]);
//     }
// }
// console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

let evens = numbers.filter(function(num){
    return num % 2 === 0;
})
console.log(evens);
//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

let hasBuffet = restaurant.filter(function(rest){
    return rest.name.includes("buffet");
})
console.log(hasBuffet);
//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!
 let coolrest = restaurant.filter(rest=>rest.name.length < 8);
console.log(coolrest);

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!
let numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
//old ways: built a loop, used var of sum and look inside of the loop of the sum += numbers[i] spit out sum of our numbers

// in es6 with .reduce(): has a couple components to it .reduce (callbackfunction, initialValue)
let sum = numbers1.reduce(function(total, num){
return total + num;
}, 0)
console.log("Our numbers added up are "+sum);


//TODO Together: Let's take a step a bit deeper with .reduce() - .reduce()'s output can take many forms and shapes. For example, let's say we wanted to have a little Javascript that would count the length of the strings in an array and return that info back to us in an object. For example: ["Codeup", "San", Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco", Cohort", "ES6"] would get us: Object { Codeup: 6, San: 3, Antonio: 7, Dallas: 6, Marco: 5, Cohort: 6, ES6: 3 }

let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San", "Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco", "Cohort", "ES6"];
let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce(function(object, element){
    object[element] = element.length;
    return object;
}, {})
console.log(strLengthObj);

//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.
// function countWords(sentence) {
//     let words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words
//
//     let wordCountObject = words.reduce(function(wordCounts, word) {
//         if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
//             // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
//             wordCounts[word] = 1;
//         } else {
//             // otherwise increment the existing count
//             wordCounts[word] += 1;
//         }
//         return wordCounts;
//     }, {}); // start with an empty object
//
//     return wordCountObject;
// }

let sentence = "Mary had a little lamb , little lamb , little lamb";
// console.log(countWords(sentence));

//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!

function countWords(sentence) {
    let words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words

    words = words.filter(function(word){
        return word !== ",";
    }) //get out of here, comma! as long as the word is not strictly equivalent to a comma in a string, that word is headed into the words array

    let wordCountObject = words.reduce(function(wordCounts, word) {
        if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
            // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
            wordCounts[word] = 1;
        } else {
            // otherwise increment the existing count
            wordCounts[word] += 1;
        }
        return wordCounts;
    }, {}); // start with an empty object

    return wordCountObject;
}

console.log(countWords(sentence));

//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).
let famArr = [{
    name: "D. Howell",
    age: 80
},{
    name: "J. Howell",
    age: 77
},{
    name: "A.G.",
    age: 26
}]

let sumFamilyAges = famArr.reduce(function(total, familyMember){
    return total + familyMember.age;
}, 0)

console.log(sumFamilyAges);
